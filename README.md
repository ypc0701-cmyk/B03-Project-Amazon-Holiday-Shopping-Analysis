## Resibonsibility:
1. Ensuring Code Integrity and Completeness
2. Transforming Analytical Insights into Visual Charts  

## Here are the chart I worked on.

**Key finding**

We found that females outspend males across all income levels during Christmas, with middle-class females displaying the strongest purchasing power. Lower-class males represent the smallest market opportunity with minimal order quantities.

### 2. How does education attainment relate to income among middle-income female consumers?

**Key finding**

Bachelor's degree holders are the largest group (54,795) among middle-class females, followed by high school graduates (39,287). Graduate degree holders represent a substantial 26,112, indicating an overall well-educated consumer segment.
### 3. How does income level vary by region among middle-class female consumers?

**Key finding**

Looking at the middle-class female segment, the South dominates with 38.6% of middle-class female consumers, making it the primary target region. The Midwest, West, and Northeast collectively account for 61%, indicating opportunities for balanced regional marketing strategies.

### 4. Why there’s a higher share of middle class female in the south compared to other region?”

**Key finding**

Analyzed the correlation between income level and education and also between education and 4 regions.
We found out people who had higher education levels tend to have higher income levels.  The south region has the highest education than other regions, so we think the education is the factor of this trend
